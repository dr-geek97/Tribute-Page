Hello world!

This is me, and i have started learning on free code camp :D

As a learning part of the Responsive Web Design Certification, we should build some mini  projects like :

=> Tribute Page : https://github.com/dr-geek97/Tribute-Page
=> Survey Form.
=> Product Landing Page
=> Technical Documentation Page
=> Personal Portfolio Webpage

In this project i'll work on a Tribute page, i'll try to apply the maximum of what i have learned in this topic.

If you have any suggestions or modifications or anything, i'll be happy to hear from you especially in this phase of learning.

Frink out ...
